    <!-- Chosen Palette: Professional Tech Focus -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured as a chronological, narrative journey through the four key phases of the GSoC plan. This linear flow is intuitive and mirrors the user's progression from learning to execution. It starts with a high-level overview (KPIs), then dives into each phase with dedicated sections. The new "Daily Schedule" section acts as a detailed drill-down, allowing users to interactively filter and view granular daily tasks by month, enhancing usability and avoiding information overload within the single-page format. This thematic, phased approach with a detailed interactive component was chosen to create a motivational and easy-to-follow story, making the dense information more digestible and actionable for the user. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - KPIs: Goal: Inform. Method: Large stat cards (HTML/CSS). Justification: High-impact, immediate view of starting strengths.
        - Phase 1 DSA Topics: Goal: Compare Composition. Method: Chart.js Doughnut Chart. Justification: Ideal for showing the proportional effort across different DSA topics.
        - Phase 1 Python Skills: Goal: Compare Categories. Method: Chart.js Horizontal Bar Chart. Justification: Clearly compares distinct skill areas to be acquired, easy to read labels.
        - Phase 2 Contribution Flow: Goal: Organize Process. Method: HTML/CSS Flowchart. Justification: Visually represents a step-by-step process clearly without using forbidden SVG/Mermaid.
        - Phase 3 Timeline: Goal: Show Change. Method: Chart.js Line Chart. Justification: Effectively shows projected progress and effort distribution over the 12-week coding period.
        - Phase 3 Proposal Anatomy & Phase 4 Execution Cycle: Goal: Organize List/Process. Method: Styled HTML lists/timeline. Justification: A clean, semantic way to present critical checklist items and sequential steps.
        - Daily Schedule: Goal: Organize/Inform. Method: Interactive Month Selector (HTML/JS) with dynamic list of daily task cards (HTML/CSS/JS). Justification: Allows users to explore a large dataset (daily tasks) by month, preventing overwhelming scroll, providing direct access to specific dates, and maintaining clickable resource links for easy access.
        - Library/Method: Chart.js for all charts (Canvas), HTML/CSS with Tailwind for all diagrams and interactive elements.
    -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
